  - Progressive overload recommendations
  - Volume calculations per set
  - Rest time tracking between sets

### Implementation Details
```swift
// Enhanced WorkoutExercise entity additions:
- setData: [SetData] // Array of individual sets
- totalVolume: Double // Calculated volume
- restTime: Int32 // Rest time for this exercise
- notes: String? // Exercise-specific notes

// New SetData model:
struct SetData {
    let setNumber: Int
    var targetReps: Int
    var actualReps: Int
    var weight: Double
    var completed: Bool
    var restTime: Int?
    var notes: String?
}
```

## Success Criteria
